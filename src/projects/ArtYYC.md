Started at the 2018 CivicTech YYC Hackathon, ArtYYC is an Android/iOS app developed in React Native geared towards enhancing the art discovery experience in Calgary, Alberta. Using predefined and collected datasets, we render art locations and information to an interactive mobile map that allows for easy discovery of local, undocumented, corporate and urban guerilla art. In addition, after launch of the alpha, a social aspect will continue development that will encourage crowd-sourcing
information about unknown art in the city.
